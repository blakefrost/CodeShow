--------

This demo project uses nodejs, socket.io and the ace code editor to broadcast edits from the broadcasting editor to client editors.

This is really just an experiment.

To run the application, ensure you have node and npm installed and run from the project root.

    node app.js

This application will start on port 8003.

Visit http://localhost:8003/broadcast.html and in another window visit http://localhost:8003/watch.html

Make edits in the editor on broadcast and see them reflected in the on watch.html.
